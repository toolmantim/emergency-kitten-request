emergency-kitten-request
========================

A demonstration of using the [Twilio](http://twilio.com/) SMS API and the [emergencykitten.com](http://emergencykitten.com/) API to send messages to those in need.

Note: because of Twilio developer limitations, the site will only send an SMS to 1 phone number (mine). If it were a paid Twilio account you could SMS any number.
